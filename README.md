# Portfolio

In this Portfolio I have to created multiple web pages that link together, and have their own content independent of the other pages.

Each page has a navigation bar with links to the accompaning pages.  The navigation bar also has a drop down menu that contains the links when the size of the browser shinks.

The index.html page has a biography about myself and a picture of me that is wrapped by the text in the biography.

The contact.html page contains a form that can be filled and submitted.  The form contains a name input box, an e-mail input box, a comments/questions box, and a submit button.

The portfolio.html page contains five placeholder images that have a border to give spacing between the images to make it visually appealing.

## Built with the following tech:

*HTML
*Bootstrap
*CSS
*Javascript
*React
