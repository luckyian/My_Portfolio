Additionally, users will have the option to save recipes for future use, which can easily be converted to a PDF to be used offline, or for the more tangible owners of the printer, printed out on paper.

I used JavaScript functions to: create a listening ability to buttons on the HTML, populate the HTML with questions, verify chosen answers with correct answers, save final score to local storage if the user wishes, if saving the score is chosen it asks for intials and saves those as well.  Upon finishing the quiz, the user is taken to the high score HTML page which pulls high scores from the local storage and displays them in order of quiz taken, oldest on top.
