The What's for Dinner? application allows the user to search for online recipes based on ingredients he/she may have on-hand. Additionally, users will have the option to save recipes for future use, which can easily be converted to a PDF to be used offline, or for the more tangible owners of the printer, printed out on paper.",

Any input recieved in the text field is saved to local storage and persists over refresh.  Time-blocks change color as the time marches on.  Red for current time, green for future, and grey for past.",
