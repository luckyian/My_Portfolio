             <p><h4> My name is Ian Wren and I live in Seattle, WA.  I am 40 years old and
                am looking for work as a front-end or full-stack developer.
             <br></br>
             <br></br>
             I am looking to have a career as software developer with a focus on web
             development. I currently work freelance for individuals and groups to design, build and deploy websites. My current projects include
             a website for a baker in western Washington state, and developing projects with new technologies to keep my skills sharp.
             <br></br>
             <br></br>
             I would like to work full-time for a software firm that allows me more time to spend with my loved ones, including my wife and
             two feline fur-babies.
             <br></br>
             <br></br>
             Some of my hobbies include playing video games, gardening, home improvement on my current
             residence, hiking, trying new foods and drinks and travelling.  My youngest fur baby, Fox "Spooky" Mulder
             enjoys going on walks or adventures around the neighborhood on his leash.
